# Introduction 

Embrace the Future of Web Development with FastAPI!

In the ever-evolving landscape of web development, staying ahead of the curve is not just an advantage; it's a necessity. Welcome to the world of FastAPI â€“ the cutting-edge web framework that redefines how we build APIs and web applications.

Imagine a framework that seamlessly combines speed, simplicity, and scalability. FastAPI does exactly that, and more. It's not just another framework; it's a paradigm shift. With its intuitive design and automatic documentation capabilities, FastAPI empowers developers to create robust APIs and web applications with unprecedented ease and efficiency.

Why FastAPI?

Speed: FastAPI lives up to its name. It's one of the fastest Python frameworks out there, making it ideal for high-performance applications where every millisecond counts.

Type Safety: Say goodbye to runtime errors. FastAPI leverages Python type hints to provide real-time feedback and catch errors before they become issues, ensuring your code is as reliable as possible.

Automatic Documentation: Documentation is often an afterthought, but not with FastAPI. It automatically generates interactive API documentation, making collaboration between developers, testers, and stakeholders a breeze.

Asynchronous Support: Modern applications demand asynchronous programming. FastAPI embraces asynchronous programming, allowing you to write efficient, non-blocking code for seamless user experiences.

Simplicity: FastAPI's intuitive syntax and easy-to-understand concepts reduce the learning curve, enabling both beginners and seasoned developers to dive in and start building powerful applications quickly.

Your Journey Begins Here!

Embarking on a FastAPI project isn't just about writing code; it's about embracing a mindset. It's about pushing boundaries, exploring new possibilities, and creating solutions that make a difference. Whether you're a seasoned developer looking to optimize your workflow or a newcomer eager to learn, FastAPI welcomes you.

Let's transform your ideas into reality, one endpoint at a time. Get ready to revolutionize the way you think about web development. FastAPI is not just a framework; it's a catalyst for innovation.

Are you ready to embark on this exciting journey? Fasten your seatbelt and let's build the future of web development together!

Happy coding! ðŸš€

         6. pip install redis
         7. pip install asyncpg
         8.  pip install pydantic[email]
      2. Commands executions:
         1. Upgrade SqlAlchemy version to actual
         2. alembic init -t async migrations 
   4. Install locally:
      1. See next chapter for system dependencies.
      2. Create your virtual env.
         1. [Click here to tutorial access ](https://blog.debugeverything.com/pt/ambientes-virtuais-com-python-virtualenv/)
      3. Install project requirements with commands.
         1. To create requirements file use this command `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
         2. `pip install -r requirements.txt` ou `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.
      4. Running migrations.
         1. `alembic upgrade head` -> to create and feed the tables with initial data.
         2. `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "name migration"` -> to create a new migration.
         3. For more information read the readme inside migrations in this [site](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/tutorial.html).
      5. Start the project
